## Projects Made at Futuregames

### No* Animal Crossing 

[**PLAY IN BROWSER**](https://jpkrohn97.itch.io/no-animal-crossing)

This was the first game I developed during my Futuregames assignments. The task was simple, create a game inspired by arcade classics such as: Mario Bros, Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Snake, Frogger...
I instatly started thinking to myself: Frogger? What if I inverted the gameplay of Frogger? I'm not playing as a frog, but the cars... What if I have to prevent the frog from crossing... and that's how I came with the idea.
Over the course of one month, and after not using Unity for nearly a year, I improvised various systems to build the core mechanics and interactions. I used free Unity assets to create a simple yet cohesive experience.

##### How do I even explain it?
Can it be described as a infinite survival tower defense game? Does it belong to an specific genre?
The game was made in mind of having one section of a city with some one way streets, boulevard and avenues, in which you can spawn cars from any of them, to hit the animals and prevent them from crossing the street, like Frogger. The game has some arcade elements, such as, an endless gameloop with the sole objective of surviving the longest. Player must compete for a high score to make it to the leader board.

#### How do you get to the leaderboard?
Does the game require skill? Yes, otherwise how are you supposed to time a car to run over... sorry, save the animals from crossing the dangerous street. Besides skills, players also **require** strategic thinking, it's easy to defeat the first waves of critters, but at some point their spawn rate is so high, that if the players haven't prepared a continous flow of cars, the animals will inebitably go through. More over, players have access to four different types of vehicles that can be used in different purposes, so think ahead, and be ready for them to come.

#### How was it received?
During that time, the guys had a blast playing it and competing one another trying to reach high-scores. I was impressed that they liked it so much. Some even commented that the original idea seemed silly and boring, but they saw the appealing of timing the cars to hit the target, and then using trucks tactically to defeat groups of enemies.

### Project Trash 

[**PLAY IN BROWSER**](https://futuregames.itch.io/projecttrash)

I would say it my most successful game so far, I not only worked as a game designer, but also, it was my first experience leading a team as a **Product Owner**. I guided a team of thirteen to create an entertaining arcade game based on my vision.

#### Development Process
Once the teams were revealed and we gained access to the Discord group, we immediately joined a Miro board to brainstorm ideas. We knew the game had to be an arcade, and optionally, it could include a green theme. During brainstorming, a UX/UI team member mentioned how fun physics-based games are. We all agreed, but we needed to narrow down the concept to fit a three-week development scope. After a second brainstorming session, my idea was chosen. From that moment on, I became the **Product Owner and spokesperson** of the team.

#### Game Concept
The game features an infinite stream of randomized items transported on a conveyor belt into a limited space that the player must keep clear to prevent overspilling. These items are different recyclable materials, which the player must sort them correctly. Incorrect sorting or dropped items count as mistakes, after a certain number of mistakes, the game ends. The goal was to combine fast-paced arcade gameplay with an educational message.

#### Jury Feedback
- The game was fun
- The pacing was slower than advertised
- A timer-based mode could replace the game-over condition
- Some items were confusing to sort
- Some bugs were present, but none were game-breaking
- Certain items were hard to grab and throw

#### Future Plans
I'm planning to upload the game to Steam, to gather player feedback and increase exposure, as I feel that Itch.io is somewhat limited. Before doing so, I intend to implement improvements based on the jury’s feedback.

### More about me
I was born and raised in Argentina, and surrounded by games since childhood. From playing card games with grandparents and boardgames with cousins, to playing sports at school and videogames with friends; I have always been a fan of the social interactions that comes out of playing games: competitiveness, cooperation, deception, and most importantly, **joy**. 
I've been thinking of making games since I was 13, and slowy but surely, I'm moving forwards with the objective of entering the industry to develop my profesional skills, gain valuable experience and build connections. My ultimate goal is making a meaningful impact on both the industry and the world.
