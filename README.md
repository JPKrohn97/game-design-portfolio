      <summary>More about me</summary>

      <p>
        I'm 28 years old, born and raised in Argentina, and surrounded by games
        since childhood. From playing card games with grandparents and boardgames
        with cousins, to playing sports at school and videogames with friends; I
        have always been a fan of the social interactions that comes out of
        playing games: competitiveness, cooperation, deception, and most
        importantly, <strong>joy</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've been thinking of making games since I was 13, and slowy but surely,
        I'm moving forwards with the objective of entering the industry to
        develop my profesional skills, gain valuable experience and build
        connections. My ultimate goal is making a meaningful impact on both the
        industry and the world.

      <h3>Boardgames</h3>

      <h4>Medivuno (Unfinished game)</h4>

      <p>
        This was my idea in which I wanted to mix the easy core of Uno, but give it
        a twist by introducing Mafia-esque roles, and on top of that make it
        closer to D&D style of chacters and situation for the players to fight
        over.
