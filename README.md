## Projects Made at Futuregames

### No* Animal Crossing
This was the first game I developed during my Futuregames assignments. The task was simple, create a game inspired by arcade classics such as: Mario Bros, Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Snake, Frogger...
I instatly started thinking to myself: Frogger? What if I inverted the gameplay of Frogger? I'm not playing as a frog, but the cars... What if I have to prevent the frog from crossing... and that's how I came with the idea.
Over the course of one month, and after not using Unity for nearly a year, I improvised various systems to build the core mechanics and interactions. I used free Unity assets to create a simple yet cohesive experience.

#### How do I even explain it?
Can it be described as a infinite survival tower defense game? Does it belong to an specific genre?
The game was made in mind of having one section of a city with some one way streets, boulevard and avenues, in which you can spawn cars from any of them, to hit the animals and prevent them from crossing the street, like Frogger. The game has some arcade elements, such as, an endless gameloop with the sole objective of surviving the longest. Player must compete for a high score to make it to the leader board.

### How do you get to the leaderboard?
Does the game require skill? Yes, otherwise how are you supposed to time a car to run over... sorry, save the animals from crossing the dangerous street. Besides skills, players also **require** strategic thinking, it's easy to defeat the first waves of critters, but at some point their spawn rate is so high, that if the players haven't prepared a continous flow of cars, the animals will inebitably go through. More over, players have access to four different types of vehicles that can be used in different purposes, so think ahead, and be ready for them to come.

#### How was it received?
During that time, the guys had a blast playing it and competing one another trying to reach high-scores. I was impressed that they liked it so much. Some even commented that the original idea seemed silly and boring, but they saw the appealing of timing the cars to hit the target, and then using trucks tactically to defeat groups of enemies.

### Project Trash
My most successful game so far.

**Project Trash** was my first experience leading a team as a **Product Owner**.  
I guided a team of **13 members** to create an entertaining arcade game based on my original vision.

#### Development Process
Once the teams were revealed and we gained access to the Discord group, we immediately joined a **Miro board** to brainstorm ideas.

We had two constraints:
- The game had to be **arcade**
- Optionally, it could include a **green theme**

During brainstorming, a UX/UI team member mentioned how fun physics-based games are. We all agreed, but we needed to narrow down the concept to fit a **three-week development scope**.

After a second brainstorming session, my idea was chosen. From that moment on, I became the **Product Owner and spokesperson** of the team.

#### Game Concept
The game features an **infinite stream of randomized items** transported on a conveyor belt into a limited space that the player must keep clear to prevent overspilling.

- Items represent different **recyclable materials**
- Players must **sort them correctly**
- Incorrect sorting or dropped items count as **mistakes**
- After a certain number of mistakes, the game ends

The goal was to combine **fast-paced arcade gameplay** with an **educational message**.

#### Jury Feedback
- The game was fun
- The pacing was slower than advertised
- A timer-based mode could replace the game-over condition
- Some bugs were present, but none were game-breaking
- Some items were confusing to sort
- Certain items were hard to grab and throw

#### Future Plans
I plan to upload the game to **Steam** to increase exposure and gather player feedback.  
Before doing so, I intend to implement improvements based on the jury’s feedback.


I would say, my most successful game so far. Project trash was my first attempt at leading a team, as their product owner. I led a team of thirteen members into creating an entertaining arcade game, based on my vision.

What was the process to make this game?
Once the teams were revealed and gave us access to the discord group, we instantly joined a Miro board to start brainstorming ideas for the game. We knew two important details: the genre was arcade, and optionally, it could have a green theme. After some time of thinking, one of the UX/UI team members, spontaneously described how physics games are so fun to play. We all agreed to it, but we had to narrowdown the idea to be able to create a realistic scope for a three-weeks game development. Long story short, I suggested doing a second brainstorming session and my idea was chosen, and with that being the product owner and spokeperson of the team. 
From that moment on, we started developing a game in which an infinite number of randomized items were transported through a conveyor belt directly to a limited space which the player had to clear to prevent overspilling. These items were different recyclable materials and had to be sorted. Each incorrect sort or items falling to the floor, was considered a mistake, after a number of mistakes it's game over. So we took arcadish elements of fast paced gameplay and made it educational.

Feedback from the Jury
* The game was fun.
* The game was not as fast as advertized.
* Instead of having a game over conditions, it could have been changed to a timer based.
* It had some bug but nothing game breaking.
* Some items were confusing to sort.
* Some items were hard to grab and throw.

Future plans
By the time I'm writing this, I'm planning to upload the game to steam, to increase the exposure and maybe see how people react to it. Before doing this, I want to make a few changes to the game to improve it based on the feedback received.
