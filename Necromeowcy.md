    We tried making a city builder game for a gamejam that was overscoped in just one week. I'm impressed what we achieved with little experience.

    <h2>Game jam theme</h2>
    <p>
      I remember that the team got together at Futuregames to brainstorm ideas a few hours before the jam start, but when it was revealed, we needed to scrap most of it. "Borrowed Time", at first glance it was a strange theme to build a game around, so we took the few ideas that could be useful and tried making them make sense. Necromancy was a big idea that was shared among most of the team members, but how could it be used? Having a dead army for what purpose? What if the necromancer is not evil and uses the dead to serve the living.

    <h2>Core concept</h2>
    <p>
      We really liked the idea of having a necromancer helping their people, using the undead to make their small town thrive. But before having the undead, they needed to create a system for the living.  
      We started off by creating a "simple" system of population that would be the core of the city builder experience. The player can command a small group of peasants to do their bidding: building <strong>houses</strong> to increase population cap, <strong>farms</strong> to feed the peasants, and then <strong>workshops</strong>, which generate building material for new buildings.  
      Without any setbacks, the game would be very easy, we needed to introduce a random element to challenge the player. We added an event system that would trigger every five in-game days, that would require the player to choose a different outcome, losing: <strong>food</strong>, <strong>materials</strong>, <strong>peasants</strong>, or other resources. Besides altering the economy, it would also provide a narrative element to explain the world.
